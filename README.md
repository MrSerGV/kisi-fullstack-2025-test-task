# Unlocks Heatmap Report

The template currently renders a list of events as a table. Your tasks for the Unlocks Heatmap Report are:

- Implement the heatmap report on the frontend using the sample data in `events.json`.
- Implement backend logic to generate PDF report from the heatmap report.

The design doesn't need to be exact. But it should be close enough.
